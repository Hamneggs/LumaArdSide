This is the Arduino sid of LUMA. It manages two independent sets of PWM banks.
Each bank uses three of the is PWM channels the atMega has, and divies them up
for each color channel. Each channel can have its own pattern, which in turn
has several parameters for fine tuning.

Signals sent to the arduino follow the same 9 byte format as the rest of the 
project:
[153][bank][channel][pattern][param 1][param 2][param 3][param 4][checksum]

The first byte is simply the value 153, and can be used to detect and prevent
bitshift mutations of the message. This check is disabled, as false alarms would
occur too often, e.g. rarely, to warrant checking the veracity of the message
after travelling over a shield USB cable.

The second byte is the bank we wnat to modify. At this point it should only be a 
binary choice, choosing between the two PWM banks: pins 3, 5, 6 and 9, 10, 11.

The channel byte represents the channel we wish to edit. If this byte is 0-2, we
edit the red, green or blue channel respectively-and independently. However, if
this value is 3, we take control of all three color channels on the given bank,
and modulate them using a preset.

The pattern byte determines the single-channel pattern or preset, depending on 
the value of the channel byte.

The parameter bytes are used to further personalize the selected pattern or preset.
If a pattern does not use all four parameter values, it uses only the amount it needs,
beginning with the first param byte, and ignores the rest.

The checksum byte is the floored average of the first 8 bytes. This is also disabled for
similar reasons.
